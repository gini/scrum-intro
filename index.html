          <li>Daily Scrum: daily sprint meeting in the team room; all team members come prepared with the updates for the meeting;
        The meeting starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing
        The meeting should happen at the same location and same time every day
        The meeting length is set (timeboxed) to 15 minutes
        All are welcome, but normally only the core roles speak

    During the meeting, each team member answers three questions:[12]

        What have you done since yesterday?
        What are you planning to do today?
        Any impediments/stumbling blocks?

            Any impediment/stumbling block identified in this meeting is documented by the ScrumMaster and worked towards resolution outside of this meeting. No detailed discussions shall happen in this meeting.

<li>Estimation:

    The team should spend time during a sprint doing product backlog grooming. This is the process of estimating the existing backlog using effort/points, refining the acceptance criteria for individual stories, and breaking larger stories into smaller stories.

        Meetings should not be longer than an hour
        Meeting does not include breaking stories into tasks
        The team can decide how many meetings are needed per week.

    The most commonly used method is the planning poker.

<li>Planning 1:

    At the beginning of the sprint cycle (every 7–30 days), a “Sprint planning meeting” is held.[10][13]

        Select what work is to be done
        Prepare the Sprint Backlog that details the time it will take to do that work, with the entire team
        Identify and communicate how much of the work is likely to be done during the current sprint
        Eight-hour time limit
            (1st four hours) Entire team:[14] dialog for prioritizing the Product Backlog
            (2nd four hours) Development Team:[15] hashing out a plan for the Sprint, resulting in the Sprint Backlog
<li>Planning 2:

At the end of a sprint cycle, two meetings are held: the “Sprint Review Meeting” and the “Sprint Retrospective”
<li>Review:

        Review the work that was completed and not completed
        Present the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. “the demo”)
        Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated
        Four-hour time limit

<li>Retrospective:

        All team members reflect on the past sprint
        Make continuous process improvements
        Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved in the next sprint?
        Three-hour time limit
        This meeting is facilitated by the ScrumMaster
